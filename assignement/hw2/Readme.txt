Problem3:
The program takes 4 constant values. These values are loaded 
into a function which looks for the max. The first two values 
are added and used as the first argument. The last two values 
are subtracted and used as the second argument. depending if 
the first argument is greater than the second one, 
then the first argument is returned, otherwise the second one is. 

output:
Enter 4 inputs to read on separate lines:
1
2
3
4

a: Print each above integers
1, 2, 3, 4
b: Add s2 and s3 and print the result
7
c: Perform logical OR on constant 4 and s3, and print the result
4
d: Shift s3 one bit left, and then print the result
8

Problem 4:
This program makes an array that has a size of 20. It has its
own values through the raw values given by the prompt. Other than that, 
it also has takes the input from the user for an array size of 20--'Fresh'. 
With these two values, the method to find the 2 lowest and 2 highest 
numbers will find the values and add them. The program will then print
those out. It loads, shifts, saves to memory cells, etc. 

output:
Solving through Raw
Initialized 'Raw' array with values: 2, 17, 28, 20, 6, 51, 20, 48, 12, 54, 3, 31, 15, 22, 46, 72, 41, 39, 30, 55
Sum of 2 largest integers
127
Sum of 2 smallest integers
5

Solving through Fresh
Enter 20 numbers to enter into Fresh array, separated by new lines
20 numbers left to store: 1
19 numbers left to store: 2
18 numbers left to store: 3
17 numbers left to store: 4
